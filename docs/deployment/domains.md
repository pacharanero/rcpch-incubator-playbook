# Top Level Domains

RCPCH uses two main TLDs for deployment: `rcpch.tech` and `rcpch.ac.uk`.

## `rcpch.tech`
Used for development, staging, testing, and utilities, as well as documentation and other non-production services.

## `rcpch.ac.uk`
Used for live and production services. This is the main domain for all the RCPCH's web presence and as such conveys the trusted Collegiate reputation of the RCPCH.

# Subdomain naming guidelines

* Keep them short
* Keep them descriptive
* Keep them consistent
