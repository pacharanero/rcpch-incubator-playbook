Signed commits enable confidence in the origin of changes.

Once setup, all signed commits will be marked with a "Verified" tag:

Follow their [official tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification) on setting up signed commits.

!!!info "Windows setup"
    Setting up on Windows may require more steps. It is strongly recommended to setup WSL2, which is already necessary for Docker.
