## Semantic Versioning

We use [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) to ensure our versions are systematically applied across all products and services.

## Bump2version

We use `bump2version` tool to simplify versioning in the `digital-growth-charts-server` and `rcpchgrowth-python` packages.
