## Contributing

We're a friendly bunch and happy to chat!

You can contact the primary developers to discuss The Incubator using [Signal or Discourse](../about/contact.md).

### How to contribute

See [Overview of Git Workflow](http://127.0.0.1:8002/developer/git/overview/#overview-of-github-workflow).

## Intellectual Property (IP) of contributions

- The copyright over the IP of The RCPCH Incubator repositories is owned by The RCPCH Incubator Team, which releases it under an open-source license. Consult the individual repository for specifics on which license we have used.

- If you submit a contribution to the repository, we ask that you agree to transfer all IP rights of the contribution, both now and in the future, to the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, in perpetuity. This clause is purely to allow RCPCH to continue to exert unchallenged copyright over open-source work. Asserting copyright is crucial to open-source work.

- For more significant contributions, we may require a Contributor Covenant to support this agreement over the transfer of title; however, for small contributions, it is probably sufficient that you have read and understood this document and that the act of submitting a PR is acceptance of these terms.

- All contributors will, of course, proudly be acknowledged in the [Acknowledgements](../about/acknowledgements.md) section (if you make a PR, remember to add yourself there!).
