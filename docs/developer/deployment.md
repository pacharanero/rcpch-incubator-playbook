# Deployment

## Microsoft Azure

The RCPCH primarily uses Microsoft Azure's cloud platform, for reasons of established use.

## API Management

The RCPCH Incubator has a self-hosted API management platform Gravitee.io which is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster within Azure and serves as a 'shop window' for RCPCH-developed APIs, documentation, and gateway access.

## Other platforms

From time to time, we may utilise other deployment platforms for convenience or specific features - examples include Netlify, GitHub Pages, and Heroku.
