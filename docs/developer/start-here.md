There exists a multitude of technological solutions to solve problems in healthcare.

Every option has pros and cons, and the field is constantly developing.

Rather than getting lost in the choice paradox, this section details concrete examples of how the RCPCH Incubator does things.

## Why do we need a playbook?

Though we derive our methods from the wider tech world's best practices, we have adapted them to fit the unique needs of healthcare. Similar to the differences between *health* economics and general economics, *health* technology is unique in a few distinct ways:

- Regulation and strict safety standards
- Need for transparency, accuracy, and reliability
- More significant impact and value delivery

## Regulation and Strict Safety Standards

Healthcare technology is specifically designed to support and improve healthcare services and patient outcomes. It includes a range of hardware, software and systems used to diagnose, treat, and monitor medical conditions.

These tools impact lives.

For this reason, they must be subject to high levels of regulation whilst meeting strict safety and quality standards.

## Transparency, Accuracy and Reliability

The consequences of mistakes in healthcare technology can have serious consequences.

Like peer review in academia, our tools should be subject to scrutiny and independent verification of performance to mitigate the risk of harm. In addition, principles like [open-source](../principles/open-source.md) and interoperability ensure these products and services are safe and effective in clinical practice. They should improve the delivery of healthcare, not add increased barriers and friction.

A black box should not decide a patient's life.

## Value delivery and impact

Though standards are necessarily higher, implementing healthcare technology enables value delivery and large-scale impact on a global scale.

The future of medicine exists - but it's unevenly distributed. 

Creating a robust, safe, and transparent foundation allows the democratisation of healthcare, improving everyone's lives.
