# General Principles

Some of these principles are taken directly from existing guidance on the practice of medicine. Because medical software is part of medicine.

* First, do no harm

* Don't get into holy wars

* Loose consensus and running code is better than neverending committees and no code.

* Experiments in code are better than lengthy debate. It's OK to throw away an experiment once it's proven one way or another.

* Choose options that are well supported in the wider tech world.

* Adopt the best practices of the wider tech world.

* If there is no clear advantage to one or other option, choose the option that leaves us the widest range of options in the future.
