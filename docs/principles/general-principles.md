We have set some general principles that combine our organisation's philosophy with tech best-practice and guidance on good medical practice. It is essential to remember that medical software is a part of medicine.

These principles are:

- First, do no harm

- No Holy Wars

- Loose consensus with *running* code always beats Death-By-Committee and *no* code

- Experimental evidence outweighs theoretical (lengthy) debate

- Use well-supported tech tools

- All else equal, choose options which generate the most future opportunities

## First, Do No Harm

Borrowed from the Hippocratic Oath, this principle emphasises avoiding negative consequences in healthcare software development. Being mindful of how changes can affect end-users,  often patients, is crucial. Every change, feature, or update can lead to new risks and vulnerabilities.

Our ultimate priority is safety, transparency, and reliability.

## No Holy Wars

Build rationally, not emotionally.

Avoid unproductive arguments over the "right" technology, framework, or methodology. Instead, focus on the needs of the current project, team, and users; choose tools which work best for the context and be willing to try new solutions.

## Loose consensus with *running* code always beats Death-By-Committee and *no* code

Collaboration and feedback are important in this field, but there are pitfalls related to the over-reliance on consensus-building and planning.

It's better to have a working Minimum Viable Product (MVP), which is iteratively improved, rather than wasting effort in exhaustive planning or deliberation.

Focus on delivering value quickly, using feedback and testing to improve over time.

Experiments allow faster iteration and can be disposed of if required.

## Experimental evidence outweighs theoretical (lengthy) debate

The foundation of the scientific method is: *if it disagrees with experiment, it's wrong*.

Regardless of the length of middle-manager speculative waffle, answers only come from building products and rigorous testing of assumptions to inform decision-making.

## Use well-supported tech tools

Instead of relying on the latest fad or trendy framework, stick to well-supported, well-maintained and widely used tools with a proven track record of success.

This saves many headaches, preventing potential clinical risks.

## All else equal, choose options which generate the most future opportunities

Often, there is no clear best decision.

If all decisions hold comparable advantages, adopt a long-term mindset by considering future implications. Choose options which confer the most flexibility, adaptability, and scalability.

This allows investing in solutions which can pivot with ever-changing environments.
