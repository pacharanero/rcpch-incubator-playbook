# RCPCH Brand Colours

We have clear brand guidance on the colours we use in our digital products. This is to ensure that our products are recognisable and consistent across all platforms.

## Python constants representing our brand colours

As part of developing Epilepsy12 we have defined some constants in Python to represent our brand colours. These are used in the codebase to ensure that we have a consistent look and feel across the application.

```python
RCPCH_LIGHTEST_GREY =  '#F3F3F3'
RCPCH_DARK_BLUE =  '#0D0D58'
RCPCH_STRONG_BLUE =  '#3366CC'
RCPCH_STRONG_BLUE_LIGHT_TINT1 =  '#668CD9'
RCPCH_STRONG_BLUE_LIGHT_TINT2 =  '#99B3E6'
RCPCH_STRONG_BLUE_LIGHT_TINT3 =  '#CCD9F2'
RCPCH_STRONG_BLUE_DARK_TINT =  '#405A97'
RCPCH_LIGHT_BLUE =  '#11A7F2'
RCPCH_LIGHT_BLUE_TINT1 =  '#4DBDF5'
RCPCH_LIGHT_BLUE_TINT2 =  '#88D3F9'

RCPCH_YELLOW_LIGHT_TINT3 =  '#FFF4BF'
RCPCH_YELLOW_DARK_TINT =  '#C5A000'
RCPCH_STRONG_GREEN =  '#66CC33'
RCPCH_STRONG_GREEN_LIGHT_TINT1 =  '#8CD966'
RCPCH_STRONG_GREEN_LIGHT_TINT2 =  '#B3E699'
RCPCH_STRONG_GREEN_LIGHT_TINT3 =  '#D9F2CC'
RCPCH_STRONG_GREEN_DARK_TINT =  '#53861B'
RCPCH_AQUA_GREEN =  '#00BDAA'
RCPCH_AQUA_GREEN_LIGHT_TINT1 =  '#40ECBF'
RCPCH_AQUA_GREEN_LIGHT_TINT2 =  '#80DED4'
RCPCH_AQUA_GREEN_LIGHT_TINT3 =  '#BFEEEA'
RCPCH_AQUA_GREEN_DARK_TINT =  '#2E888D'
RCPCH_PURPLE =  '#7159AA'
RCPCH_PURPLE_LIGHT_TINT1 =  '#AE4CBF'
RCPCH_PURPLE_LIGHT_TINT2 =  '#C987D4'
RCPCH_PURPLE_LIGHT_TINT3 =  '#E4C3EA'

```

## SCSS variables representing our brand colours

We also have SCSS variables representing our brand colours. These are used in the stylesheets to ensure that we have a consistent look and feel across the application.

```scss
$rcpch-blue: #131111;
$rcpch-pink: #e0e0e0;
$rcpch-orange: #ff2323;
$rcpch-red: #005f20;
$rcpch-darkgrey: #c8cacc; // note this is different from the Python constant equivalent
```

<!-- NOTE SEEMS TO BE AT LEAST ONE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN SCSS AND PYTHON - NEED TO CHECK -->
