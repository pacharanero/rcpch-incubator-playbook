## About the RCPCH Incubator

The RCPCH Incubator is an official project of the RCPCH aimed at bringing clinicians, software developers, and other experts together to develop clinical software to realise the potential of digital health in international paediatrics and child health.

## About the RCPCH Incubator Playbook

This playbook is a set of free, openly published guidelines developed to help define the technical and operational standards used by the Incubator, in order to orient new team members, and make a statement of our intent around technical, security, and other standards.
