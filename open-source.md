# Open Source

The RCPCH Incubator believes in open source software being significantly safer, more secure, and more scientific than proprietary or closed source models, especially in the field of child health and for international development.

## What is open source?

Open source software simply means that the source code of the software is published openly. Nothing more and nothing less. Various different variants of this primary feature exist, and they are described in the open source license.

Open source software is still copyrighted in the same way as closed source, the RCPCH still owns the copyright on the software and will defend this if necessary.

## Why does the RCPCH believe so strongly in open source?

We accept that open source development is not yet mainstream in the healthcare tech sector. However for several reasons we have chosen to lead the way in open source healthcare.

Open source software is comparable to the open academic publication of medical knowledge. We wouldn't trust any other medical intervention if there was no open publication of the science around its use, and software should be no different. As medical software evolves from basic admin and reporting clinical systems of the past into more active clinical digital tools, the trust imbued by open source becomes vastly more important.

RCPCH is a charity and has a particular focus on international development and improvements in global child health. We fimly believe that making all source code open ensures the widest possible use of the improvements made by the RCPCH, and ensures that no 

Trends in wider tech sector - Microsoft (acquiring GitHub), Google (Golang, Kubernetes) and examples of open source from Facebook (GraphQL, ReactJS), and Netflix (Chaos Monkey)

## Does open source preclude a sustainable commercial model around a piece of software?

No, not at all. Open source software is the only ethical way to develop healthcare software, but this does not preclude the RCPCH developing non-exploitative business models around the software


## Common open source fallacies

### "Hackers can access the source code which makes it easier to hack our systems"

This is false. Hackers may or may not have access to source code of proprietary software, which is frequently leaked online following cybersecurity breaches of even huge multinational companies. Relying on obscurity within your source code rather than inherently secure practices is poor practice.

Conclusion open source is no less secure than proprietary software. In fact, knowing that your would-be attacker *definitely does* have access to source code helps to drive higher standards of security practice right from the start of any project.

### "Open source software is anti-commercial"

Open source software is possible to be commercialised in many of the same ways as proprietary software. There are many examples in the wider tech world of successful businesses releasing open source code - Wordpress.org, Discourse.org, and of course Red Hat and Canonical. 

In a modern digital healthcare setting, most organisations do not want to self-host software that they can get as a secure, reliable managed service. The most attractive ways to commercialise software in healthcare are provision of services around the code - hosting, development, integration, and Software As A Service (SaaS) offerings, and all of these are absolutely possible with open source.

### "The source code is an intangible asset which our finance director has valued at $Xmillion"

This is simply creative accounting intended to drive up the net worth of an organisation on paper. It is not related to any measure of value of the code. The most effective way to realise return on investment for software is to provide robust, trusted services around a secure code base.
